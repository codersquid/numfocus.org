============

NumFOCUS Website

This is the source of the pelican-based NumFOCUS.org site.  These pages should
be generated from these sources and then pushed to the actual site.

The site is based on Pelican:  http://docs.getpelican.com/


Workflow
========
To add/modify content to the website, please fork the numfocus/numfocus.org
repository on github and make your changes as described below.  When your
changes are ready, please submit a pull request (PR) to have those changes
merged in.  Please apply all changes via PRs.  It makes is much easier for
others to follow changes.  Finally, if you merge a PR, you are responsible for
deploying it or delegating that task in the PR discussion.


Adding Content
==============
The site is organized as a blog with a set of post categories.  Each post
categorized post will show up in the news feed as well as in its designated
category.  To add new content, create a .rst file in the appropriate category
directory in content.  For example, to add the minutes from the most recent
board meeting, you should add a file to the "Board Meetings" directory.  Posts
should provide a title and a date i.e

    inSCIght
    ########
    :date: 07-05-2013

Posts can optionally provide a `:slug:` field.  The slug is used to generate a
direct link to the post.  If no slug is provided, the title ("inSCIght" in the
above example) will be used.


Adding Images
=============

Images should be added to the with `content/images` directory.  If the filename is
`spam.jpg`, the path image path in RST is: `|filename|/images/spam.jpg`  The funny
`|filename|` syntax is how Pelican manages internal links.  The `content` directory
forms the root for paths.

===============================

For this to work, please set your github remote 'upstream' to
