&lt;p&gt;While not represented in our blog activity, 2014 turned out to be a very busy year for NumFOCUS. We sponsored more projects, gained new board members, and added programs.  It has been hard to keep up with all the activity within the organization, but perhaps much harder for those outside.  Let me go through a few of the highlights from the year to get folks caught&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we had the first election process. This has allowed us to welcome Lorena Barba, Brian Granger, Stefan Karpinski and Cindee Madison to the board of directors. In an effort to grow the number of people helping out we have also formed two new ways for people to contribute: Advisor Council and Vice President roles. The inaugural advisor council consists of Fernando Perez and Travis Oliphant. They will help guide the organization as it grows in both scope and operations. The new Vice President are Sheila Miguez, James Powell and Ben Zaitlen, all committed community members who have helped in various ways to get us started. We are always looking for more volunteers to help build our organization, but with these added team members we hope to continue to deliver high quality services to our&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the year we held four &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydata.org/"&gt;PyData conferences&lt;/a&gt;, supported one &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://numfocus.github.io/numfocus.org/news/2014/07/01/john-hunter-technology-fellowship-awarded/"&gt;John Hunter Technology Fellow&lt;/a&gt;, lead Women in Technology bootcamps, helped between 20 and 30 conference attendees travel to important conferences, and more. As the new year starts, we will be doing many of these things plus working with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://training-up.org/"&gt;Training Up&lt;/a&gt; program. We see the need to not only sponsor projects but to create important programs that get the community together. As always, we are always looking for more volunteers for these events, so &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto://info&amp;#64;numfocus.org"&gt;please do get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most exciting things that we did this year is expand our language scope from a Python centric organization to include several non-Python projects. We have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ropensci.org/"&gt;ROpenSci&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://julialang.org/"&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; now a part of our line up. Joining us on the education front are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; and sister organization &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://datacarpentry.org"&gt;Data Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;.  We also finished signing our Pyhton projects that we had been working with for a while including: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sympy.org/"&gt;SymPy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/"&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.astropy.org/"&gt;AstroPy&lt;/a&gt;.  While fiscal sponsorship doesn’t make sense for every project, it is a service we happily provide to help projects sustain and grow in natural&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming year, we plan to be a great deal more vocal about our activities. Personally, two major goals I have is to expand our reach to Europe and start making headway on project governance recommendations. But that is another&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;

These past two years we have successfully found funding for numerous events, several projects, and continue to grow in membership.  The current board has worked hard to start something from scratch and part of that process is defining how to rotate the board. NumFOCUS will be hosting its first elections this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-offices"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New&amp;nbsp;Offices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election will open up two board positions and a number of titled positions for running different aspects of the community.  These positions include the following Vice President&amp;nbsp;offices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for managing the NumFOCUS web&amp;nbsp;presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for coordinating fundraising events and corresponding with&amp;nbsp;sponsors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for managing web content, blogs, and corresponding with&amp;nbsp;membership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programs&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for coordination of NumFOCUS sponsored programs such as fellowships, conference events, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assistant Treasurer&lt;/strong&gt;: Responsible for managing project funds and correspondence with those&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="nominate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nominate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this coming months, NumFOCUS would like to give an opportunity to the community nominate new board members.  In the future, NumFOCUS would like to have open general elections, but this year we have opted for the current board to pick the next board. This decision was not reached lightly as we give high value to open source principles of openness and transparency. The mutual feeling though was to continue to grow the community, we need to actively pursue a wide breadth of individuals. The best way to achieve this is for the current board to pick individuals that are able to fill gaps corresponding to the organizations&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who-to-nominate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who to&amp;nbsp;nominate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who makes a good NumFOCUS board member? First we are looking for people who are passionate about scientific / technical computing tools. Second, we are looking for leaders in the community who are able to connect NumFOCUS with important projects that are highly used. Finally, we have some specific needs such as web development and accounting skills and members of the R or Julia&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board also tries to maintain a diverse mix of individuals from academia, industry, and research laboratories. While there is no quota to this mix, this consideration will be kept in mind when choosing the next&amp;nbsp;board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="terms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current board was elected without terms kept in mind. While we love all our board members, we realize that a rotating board has many advantages. Going forward we would like to have yearly elections with each board member elected to a two year term. By alternating between half the board being elected each year, we will have a fair amount of overlap to keep the day to day affairs in order.  Board members will not be limited to a specific number of&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="schedule"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have the newly elected board installed by the annual SciPy conference in Austin, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt; July 6-12, 2014.  We will be accepting nominations until May 28, 2014.  At that point the board will contact the nominated people and update the board membership upon&amp;nbsp;acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-to-nominate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to&amp;nbsp;nominate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nominate an individual, or nominate yourself, please send an email to  &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:admin&amp;#64;numfocus.org"&gt;admin&amp;#64;numfocus.org&lt;/a&gt; with details about the individual and why you think they would be a good&amp;nbsp;fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
