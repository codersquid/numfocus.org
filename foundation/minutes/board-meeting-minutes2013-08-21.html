<h4><span class="caps">FSA</span> discussion with Tony&nbsp;Sebro</h4>
<p>Limited liability protection is afforded to the projects as well as a greater
level of service, while it requires more&nbsp;oversight.</p>
<p>Grantor/grantee model is more of an arm’s length relationship.  Only
requirements are that the money is spent in accordance with the 501c3
regulations. But project members are still an unincorporated loose coalition,
tax liability is unclear for the projects,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Discussion of concrete example: Microsoft donation to IPython (paid to&nbsp;NumFOCUS).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>paying developer in France to write&nbsp;tutorials</li>
<li>hiring <span class="caps">US</span> developer (ex-Cal Poly student) as contractor for a&nbsp;year</li>
</ol>
<p>Question is if these two things work well under grantor-grantee model, or would
it work better as comprehensive&nbsp;sponsor.</p>
<p>#2 can be done. IPython writes up a grant, wants <span class="caps">NF</span> to allocate money to fund
developer. <span class="caps">NF</span> contracts with developer. <span class="caps">NF</span> responsibility: check developer
output is in keeping with the grant. Main thing to be careful for: don’t look
like pass-through agent to <span class="caps">IRS</span>. Need paper trail showing IPython pitched the
idea, <span class="caps">NF</span> reviewed it, it’s in the scope of <span class="caps">NF</span>, then <span class="caps">NF</span> drafted contract with
developer. This becomes even more important if you want to fund&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>Holding assets becomes more difficult in grantor-grantee model. Who owns IPython&nbsp;trademark?</p>
<p>Being done now: Julia trademarks possible in future, astronomy library&nbsp;copyright.</p>
<p>Assigning copyright is fine. Filing trademarks is hard if you’re not the entity
using/producing the trademarked thing. One individual developer could do it
(which is awkward); <span class="caps">NF</span> could still pay for it though. Dev can then assign
trademark to <span class="caps">NF</span>, <span class="caps">NF</span> has to draw up a license for it (so project/developers can
continue to use it). Solution may be to have a very broad trademark license.
Other solution is to license to all leaders of the project. Yet another
solution (also for reducing liability of individual devs): project incorporates
(but doesn’t file for 501(c)3&nbsp;status).</p>
<p><span class="caps">NF</span> also can’t then just give it away under all circumstances - only in the <span class="caps">US</span>
but not to a foreign org (it’d have to be sold for market&nbsp;value).</p>
<p>Upside of grantor-grantee model compared to comprehensive model: actions of one
project cannot affect all other projects under the&nbsp;“umbrella”.</p>
<p>Questions for&nbsp;Tony:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Q: <span class="caps">SWC</span> time effort, practical day-to-day workflow with&nbsp;projects?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It depends… “Dormant” projects that don’t receive donations, don’t raise
money, don’t create liability, require very little time. When projects want
to host conferences themselves, that takes a ton of work.  For a
grantor-grantee project, it’s much harder to run a conference or any other
event that requires signing contracts for a venue, renting space, etc.
Licensing issues can take time too, they require more legal scrutiny. <span class="caps">SWC</span>
has two full-time staff for 29 projects, the bulk of the time is consumed
by ~ ⅓ of&nbsp;those.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: Under grantor/grantee, could <span class="caps">NF</span> still offer things like “10 hours of legal
support per year, to be used by the project as&nbsp;needed”?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some tricky nuances there: Tony’s retainer is with <span class="caps">NF</span>, but the
discussions would be with third-parties that are not covered by
attorney-client privilege as the projects do not belong to <span class="caps">NF</span>.  A
relationship would have to be established with the individual projects.
Tony will need to think more about this&nbsp;one.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: Does every single expense need a grant? How would small things like paying
for pizza for a meeting, or a night of hotel for a developer&nbsp;work?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some things are easy, e.g. a recurring cost for a hosting service.  One-off
expenses should be recorded, though it can be relatively&nbsp;simple.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Needed for all money distributed: grant request, grant approval and proof
(i.e. a receipt) that the money was spent consistent with the&nbsp;request.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: Can the grant application process have “levels” for small/medium/large&nbsp;sizes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the <span class="caps">IRS</span> just expects standard business practices regarding diligence.
Important: there must be a way of linking requests, approvals in board
minutes and receipts. The paper trail needs to be easy to track and follow,
in case an audit is required. <span class="caps">SWC</span> uses the open source Ledger, but it’s a
low-level command-line tool, they are looking for a better open source
solution. Even proprietary solutions like Quicken don’t work very well for
non-profit, only quite expensive solutions work well for non-profit&nbsp;work.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: Can <span class="caps">NF</span> work as ‘comprehensive’ sponsor for some projects and
grantor/grantee for others? Does it raise red flags for the <span class="caps">IRS</span>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it can be done. <span class="caps">SWC</span> is considering doing that and has talked to other
non-profits about that idea.  Fiscal sponsorship is already something that
tends to attract heightened <span class="caps">IRS</span> scrutiny, this probably won’t add any more
to that&nbsp;scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: Is there any experience working with academics working for Universities on
grantor-grantee model?  Specifically, we would like to avoid the large
overhead fees that Universities charge on federal&nbsp;grants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the most part the academic worlds are kept completely separate from the
<span class="caps">SWC</span> work. Have not had to deal with granting money to University sponsored
projects. <span class="caps">SWC</span> tries to be part of the process for hiring employees with
project to make sure the due diligence is followed, in those instances we
probably would not go with an&nbsp;academic.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="caps">SWC</span> uses ~ $75/hour as their standard rate for contractors, they need to
go to the board for anything above&nbsp;that.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: Member project raises money themselves. Is there a mechanism in
grantor-grantee model that allows for that money to go to <span class="caps">NF</span>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money follows from use of trademark (t-shirts, conference, etc.). <span class="caps">NF</span> can be
beneficiary of this money, but if trademark is not owned by <span class="caps">NF</span> then person
raising the money is entitled to keep&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: You (Tony) saw an ambiguity in current <span class="caps">FSA</span>. What needs to change in the
<span class="caps">FSA</span> in order for it to fit the grantor-grantee&nbsp;model?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to go to the grantor-grantee model I suggest you start over.
Section 2C of the <span class="caps">SWC</span> agreement was taken out, which wouldn’t exist in a
grantor-grantee relationship. The grantor-grantee <span class="caps">FSA</span> would need to&nbsp;contain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Agreement that <span class="caps">NF</span> accepts donations on behalf of&nbsp;project.</li>
<li>Agreement that <span class="caps">NF</span> allocates that money through&nbsp;grants.</li>
<li>Outline the structure under which the project can make grant requests to
<span class="caps">NF</span> (this is completely missing in <span class="caps">SWC</span> agreement, because it’s not&nbsp;needed).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Q: How difficult is it for a <span class="caps">NF</span> to switch types of&nbsp;sponsorship?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be easy to move from a grantor-grantees relationship to
comprehensive.  But the major problem with any termination is what happens
with the assets.  From gg-&gt;comp you keep ownership, from comp-&gt;gg you might
either have to grant the assets to another 5013c or sell it at market&nbsp;rate.</p>
<p>Tony: We have a threshold question, “Do we want a comprehensive or
grantor/grantee&nbsp;model?”</p>
